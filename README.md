<h1>Responsive - Resume</h1>

A single-page résumé template done purely with HTML and CSS, which can be rendered into PDF through web browsers' print-to-PDF functionality, making a nice, sleek, professsional and ready-to-print résumé. 
See hosted site at : 

As the résumé is purely typeset with HTML and CSS, it's highly customizable (e.g. if you want an "objective" section, just copy-paste a few HTML elements) and does not require proprietary software. All you need is a text editor and a web browser (see compatibility section below). Oh, maybe some intermediate CSS knowledge. And, since it's open source with Apache License, you're allowed (and encouraged!) to create your own fine-tuned template and share with others.
